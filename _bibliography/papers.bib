  abstract = "This study aimed to characterize arterial dendritic cells (DCs)
              in polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) and giant cell arteritis (GCA).
              Bulk RNA-sequencing, RT-PCR and immunofluorescence analyses were
              performed from temporal arteries from GCA, PMR and control
              patients. Public single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data on
              Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) were analyzed from
              three GCA and three control patients. Bulk RNA-Seq and RT-PCR
              analyses demonstrated a high level of expression of DC lineage
              markers (CD209), DC maturation markers (CD83, CCR7) and
              chemokines associated with DC maturation in GCA arteries. The
              level of expression of DC lineage and DC maturation associated
              genes was significantly lower in PMR than in GCA arteries and
              similar between PMR and control arteries. GCA arteries expressed
              high levels of GM-CSF and IFNG mRNA. ScRNA-seq analysis of GCA
              PBMCs demonstrated high expression of IFNGR and CSF2R by
              classical monocytes and cultures of CD14(+) monocytes with GM-CSF
              and IFN-$\gamma$ were able to promote their differentiation into
              monocyte derived-DCs (mo-DCs). This work provides evidence that
              mo-DCs infiltrate GCA lesions and could be generated under the
              influence of GM-CSF and IFN-$\gamma$ from monocytes infiltrating
              the arterial wall. Mo-DCs could play an important role in GCA
              pathogenesis and be targeted by GM-CSF and/or IFN-$\gamma$
              inhibitors.",

	abstract = {In solid organ transplantation, monocytes and macrophages play a cross-cutting role in the rejection process, irrespective of the transplanted tissue and the type of rejection. Here, we integrated multiple single-cell assays (\&gt;150,000 cells) with a broad spectrum of blood-derived and renal allograft-derived cells. We observed 6 myeloid cell trajectories enriched in the allograft during rejection, ranging from circulating CD14+ monocytes to differentiated macrophages in the kidney, with one trajectory culminating in a pro-inflammatory macrophage expressing CXCL9 and CXCL10. By analyzing over 850 biopsies using deconvolution, we report that they are absent in pre-transplant allografts, while these CXCL10+ macrophages are the immune cells most associated with inflammation during acute rejection. Furthermore, a survival study of over 500 biopsies indicates that they increase the risk of graft loss independently of other immune cells. CXCL10+ macrophages differentiate from recipient monocytes, and we have identified 6 major genes associated with their differentiation, including LILRB2. In vitro, mimicking allogenic activation of blood monocytes via the CD47/SIRP-a axis induced overexpression of LILRB2, suggesting that CXCL10+ macrophages are activated by this pathway. Finally, we show that macrophages overexpressing LILRB2 induce the proliferation of autologous T lymphocytes. Altogether, the present study provides further insight into the pro-inflammatory axes of recipient-derived monocytes/macrophages, and suggests LILRB2 as a therapeutic target.},
